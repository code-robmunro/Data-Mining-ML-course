The same for produce (fruit and veggies). I notice that the popularity of whole milk and certain other things like soda or bottled water in transactions tends to take up a large portion of the associations. I found it interesting that the stereotype of desperately needing to buy milk and bread before inclimate weather is not very well supported as an association in regular everyday transactions. It does make the list but has fairly low support (0.025)."
